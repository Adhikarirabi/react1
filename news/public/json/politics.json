      "description": "Living matter moves, deforms, and organizes itself. In cells this is made possible by networks of\npolymer filaments and crosslinking molecules that connect filaments to each other and that act as\nmotors to do mechanical work on the network. For the case of highly cross-linked filament networks,\nwe d...",

In practice, since rare events are by\ndefinition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What ar...",
